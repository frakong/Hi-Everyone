# Hi-Everyone
A little intro

Hello! My name is Franklin Kong. I am currently a student at UC Davis who is studying for a Master's degree in Computer Science. I am studying to be a software engineer and am currently working on projects that can be used to sharpen the skills I've been learning.\
Some of these skills I'm learning include: Java, C, Python, HTML/CSS, Javascript.\
Feel free to try out my projects!
